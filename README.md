# TRAM2FLOWS

## Overview

This GitHub repository houses a cutting-edge project that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify dependencies between Red Team attack techniques. The system utilizes MistralAI, in conjunction with LangChain, to perform advanced analysis and reasoning for the identification of unsecured assets in the realm of cyber threat intelligence.

## Key Features

1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** The project employs RAG techniques to enhance the identification of dependencies among Red Team attack techniques. This innovative approach leverages natural language processing and machine learning for more accurate and nuanced results.

2. **MistralAI and LangChain Integration:** MistralAI is seamlessly integrated with LangChain to enable complex reasoning in the identification of unsecured assets. This powerful combination enhances the system's ability to analyze and comprehend cyber threat intelligence data.

3. **Machine Learning Model:** The project incorporates a machine learning model to augment penetration testing capabilities. Utilizing popular libraries such as scikit-learn, SciPy, NumPy, Keras, and PyTorch, the model is designed to provide insights into the relationships and dependencies between different Red Team attack techniques.
